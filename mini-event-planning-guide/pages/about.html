          <p>
            Choi & Co. Events was born from the passion of Ms. Jade, a natural organizer with a love for celebrating life’s most cherished moments. It all began with simple yet heartfelt family gatherings — birthdays, reunions, and holiday parties — where her talent for transforming spaces into magical settings stood out.
            <br><br>
            Encouraged by family and friends, Ms. Jade turned her hobby into a growing business that serves clients throughout the community. Her goal? To bring the same warmth and attention to detail to every event, big or small, just like she did for her own loved ones. Today, Choi & Co. Events is known for personalized service, creative design, and an unwavering commitment to excellence.
